# AI-Spec-Driven-Book

This project aims to create a comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) approach. It includes a backend for content generation and management, and a frontend for displaying the book content.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Contains the backend services, likely for AI model integration and data processing.
- `book_frontend/`: Houses the Docusaurus-based frontend for the textbook.
- `specs/`: Holds the specifications, plans, and tasks for different features of the project following SDD principles.
- `history/`: Stores prompt history records and architectural decision records.
- `.specify/`: Contains templates and scripts for the SDD workflow.
