# Hardware Lab: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Infrastructure

## Learning Objectives
- Analyze the computational requirements for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics applications
- Evaluate hardware configurations for simulation, training, and deployment scenarios
- Understand the trade-offs between performance, power consumption, and cost
- Apply systematic approaches to hardware selection for different Physical AI use cases

## Introduction

The hardware infrastructure for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics represents a convergence of three computationally intensive domains: physics simulation, visual perception, and generative AI. Unlike traditional AI applications that operate purely in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must process real-time sensor data, perform complex physics calculations, and execute sophisticated control algorithms simultaneously. This creates unique hardware requirements that demand careful consideration of processing power, memory bandwidth, storage capacity, and power efficiency.

The computational demands of Physical AI arise from several factors: the need for real-time processing of high-dimensional sensor data (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs), the complexity of physics simulation for robot-environment interactions, the computational overhead of deep learning models for perception and decision-making, and the requirement for low-latency control systems that ensure robot stability and safety.
