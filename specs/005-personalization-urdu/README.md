# Personalization and Urdu Translation - Syllabus Compliance Summary

## Overview
This feature implements content personalization and Urdu translation for the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook while ensuring strict adherence to the course syllabus and learning outcomes.

## Course Context
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course includes four key modules:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Core Learning Outcomes
All personalized and translated content must maintain alignment with these learning outcomes:
1. Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
2. Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
3. Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
4. Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
5. Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
6. Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

## Syllabus Compliance Requirements

### For Personalization
- Content adaptation must preserve all core technical concepts regardless of difficulty level
- Module-specific requirements must be maintained (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, VLA)
- Practical exercises and hands-on activities must remain intact
- Assessment criteria and project requirements must be preserved
- Technical specifications and hardware requirements must be maintained

### For Urdu Translation
- Technical accuracy of robotics and AI concepts must be preserved
- All core concepts related to embodied intelligence and physical AI must be maintained
- Code examples and technical diagrams must remain accurate
- Practical exercises must retain their educational value

## Validation Mechanisms
- API responses include syllabus compliance metadata
- Personalized content undergoes validation to ensure learning outcomes are met
- Translation accuracy is validated for technical concepts
- Missing topics are identified and addressed

## Key Changes Made
1. Enhanced the feature specification with syllabus compliance requirements
2. Updated API contract to include compliance validation
3. Added specific user stories for syllabus-compliant personalization
4. Defined functional and compliance requirements to maintain educational integrity
